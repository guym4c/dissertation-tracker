A toy Java EJB project, created during the Web Applications & Services module at Sussex University.

Repository made public under Apache license after module was completed and marks released. Code provided to help others create similar projects in Java, and to add some Java to my GitHub profile! It is assumed that future yearsâ€™ assignments will be sufficiently different (in line with best assessment practice) and so this will not provide assistance beyond that already available.
